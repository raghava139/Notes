Differences between FormData and Normal Object:
-----------------------------------------------

FormData:
-------------

---> Suitable for sending files and other form data, such as text fields or checkboxes.
---> Automatically sets the Content-Type header to multipart/form-data.
---> Easily handles files and allows appending multiple fields of different types.


Normal Object for JSON:
-----------------------

--->Requires setting the Content-Type header to application/json.
--->Suitable for sending structured JSON data, but handling files within JSON can be more complex.
--->If sending files, you might need to encode them as base64 strings or use other methods, increasing payload size.
